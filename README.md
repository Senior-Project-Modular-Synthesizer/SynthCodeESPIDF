# Name of Synth
## What is a Modular Synth?
A modular synth is a type of synthesizer that is made from seperate modules connected together via patch cables. Each module has a specific, and basic, function. Each module connects together to creame something more than the sum of its parts. The modular synth can give you any sound you want. Complex sounds can be made by simple easy to understand modules.

#### Eurorack
The most common format for modular synths is Eurorack. Eurorack specifies the height, width, and voltages of modules. This allows modules from different manufacturers to be used together. The standard width of a module is 3U (128.5mm) and the height is 3U (128.5mm). The standard voltage range is -10v to 10v.

### Why Modular Synths?
Modular synths are physical and tactile. Just like a piano, the tactile feedback leads to a connection with your music that you won't get from software.  

### The Problem with Synths

#### Expensive
Modular synths are expensive. A single module with circuitry an Electrical Engineering Sophomore can make can cost $200. A full modular synth can cost thousands of dollars.

#### Single Function
Each module has a single function. Once you spend money on a module, you're locked into its behavior. If you don't need it for a particular sound, it just takes up space in your rack.

## Our Goal
Our goal is to develop a module capable of taking on the behavior of any module. We want it to be reprogrammable, so it can be used for any sound. We want it to be affordable, so anybody can use it in their projects. And we want it to be accessable. So anybody with an idea and a little bit of programming skill can write their own module.
